You can specify an expiry time if you want your note to automatically disappear / delete after the time has expired.

The unit can be specified as months, days, hours, or minutes, with a minimum of 1 minute.

For example: 
- `3 hours` or
- `15 minutes` or
- `1 month`

## Setting the expiry for an individual note

You can set an expiry just for a specific note by adding a `share_expires` frontmatter text property, and adding an expiry time as above.

```yaml
share_expires: 7 days
```

## Setting an expiry for all notes

If you want all notes to expire by default, set this in the plugin Settings page.
